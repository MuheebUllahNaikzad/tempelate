   The Man Who Watered a Dog*

The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said:

 “While a man was walking, he felt very thirsty. He found a well, went down, drank, and came out. Then he saw a *dog panting* from thirst. The man went back into the well, filled his shoe with water, and gave it to the dog. Allah appreciated his deed and *forgave him*.”  
*(Bukhari & Muslim)*

*Lesson*: Kindness to all creatures, even animals, is rewarded by Allah.

      The Prophet and the Woman Who Threw Trash*

Every day, an old woman used to *throw garbage* on Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) as he passed by her house. One day, no trash came. He inquired and found she was *sick*. The Prophet (ﷺ) *visited her*, and she was so touched by his character that she *accepted Islam*.

*Lesson*: Responding to hate with patience and mercy wins hearts

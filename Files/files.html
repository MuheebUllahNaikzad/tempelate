*The Forgiving Merchant*

Once during the time of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), there was a *wealthy merchant* known for his fairness. He used to lend money to the poor and struggling people. But what made him special was his habit:

*Whenever he saw someone unable to pay, he would forgive the debt.*

His workers once asked, “Why do you forgive so much? Won’t you suffer losses?”

He replied, “If I forgive people here, maybe *Allah will forgive me on the Day of Judgment*.”

Years passed, and the man passed away. A pious man saw him in a dream and asked, “What did Allah do with you?”

He smiled and said:

> “When I stood before Allah, He said, ‘You used to forgive My servants. Today, I forgive *you*. Enter Paradise.’”

*(This story is based on an authentic Hadith – Sahih Muslim)*


*Moral*: Mercy and forgiveness toward others can earn Allah’s mercy for us.</p>
